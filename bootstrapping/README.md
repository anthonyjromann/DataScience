# Bootstrapping Project - Anthony Roman
## This project attempts to understand bootstrapping through a real-world example

#### This README file will be updated with tasks to do as they are created and accomplished. The end goal of this file is to provide a reader with some background information which may not be covered in detail throughout the code and supplementary comments.

### Task List:
##### ·Obtain data to work with. (DONE)
##### ·Create requirements.txt and import necessary libraries.
##### ·Perform EDA, data visualization, and data cleaning to prepare for training.
##### ·Split data, train using bootstrapping methods.
##### ·Test the model with a testing set, and possibly a hold-out testing set (for further validation).
##### ·Evaluate results, refactor code, update README.

### Completed Tasks:
##### ·The dataset was obtained from the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The dataset is "Homo sapiens chromosome 19 clone CTC-448F2, complete sequence". The DNA sequence length is 179005.
